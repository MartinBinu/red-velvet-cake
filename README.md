Red velvet is made with cocoa powder, vinegar and buttermilk. The chemical reaction between these ingredients help give the cake a deep maroon color that is often enhanced by extra food coloring.Red velvet cake has less cocoa powder added to it so the chocolate flavor is much more mild. 

Both our chocolate cake and red velvet cake use buttermilk, but buttermilk is a required ingredient for red velvet cake. It also has vinegar and red food coloring added to it to add acidity and the classic red coloring.
